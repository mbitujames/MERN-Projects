# MERN Stack Application Testing and Debugging

## Overview

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application with a comprehensive testing and debugging setup to ensure high reliability, stability, and maintainability.

---

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy covers all layers of the application:

### 1. Unit Testing
- Utility functions and middleware tested on both client and server.
- React components tested in isolation using React Testing Library.
- Achieved high code coverage for critical features.

### 2. Integration Testing
- API endpoints tested using Supertest with an in-memory test database.
- React component integration tests for components interacting with APIs.
- Authentication flows and form submissions tested thoroughly.

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Cypress is configured for end-to-end testing.
- Tests cover critical user flows including registration, login, CRUD operations.
- Navigation, routing, error handling, and edge cases are tested.
- Visual regression tests ensure UI consistency.

---

## Debugging Techniques

- Server-side logging middleware captures detailed request logs with timestamps, status codes, and durations.
- Global error handler middleware manages server errors gracefully.
- React error boundaries catch and log client-side errors, displaying fallback UI.
- Performance monitoring middleware logs request durations for optimization insights.
- Browser developer tools are used for client-side debugging during development.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both client and server:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
3. Set up the test database:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-test-db
   ```
4. Run tests:
   - Run all tests:
     ```bash
     npm test
     ```
   - Run unit tests only:
     ```bash
     npm run test:unit
     ```
   - Run integration tests only:
     ```bash
     npm run test:integration
     ```
   - Run end-to-end tests only:
     ```bash
     npm run test:e2e
     ```

## Additional Notes on Testing Strategy

- Tests are organized into unit, integration, and end-to-end categories to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- Unit tests focus on isolated components and functions to catch issues early.
- Integration tests verify the interaction between components, APIs, and the database.
- End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios to validate the entire application flow.
- Continuous integration and automated testing are recommended to maintain code quality.
